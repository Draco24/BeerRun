In priority order, unless solution investigation determines otherwise.

- fix some polish bugs
    - Fix the ${beersToWin} variable injection
    - In Level 2 you can't drink beer even though it says you have 5
    - add scripting to allow the player to move
        - might involve some work with the actor/component system to add a new actor to the Player instance.  This could tie in with the Actor, or Game Object, system overhaul.
- remove Player from Level as a separate member, and add it to Actors array
- standardize message passing and use it more!
- separate drawing and update loop
- make GameObject a real generic game object, or actor, which really only implements a message passing framework
- add a Scene class and move most setup/update/teardown logic into an implementation of that
